# collaborations
This is a project in collaborative music making with code! Here's how it works:

1. A music seed idea in the form of code (e.g. SuperCollider) will be presented. 
2. Anyone is invited to take part in its transformation into a full scale piece.
3. The merging of any pull requests will be determined by project leaders (just one for now but hopefully more later), but forked remixes are encouraged.

Let's make music together!
